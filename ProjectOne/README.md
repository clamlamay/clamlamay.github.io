### Deliverables and Approach

I wanted to accomplish functions I could not complete during the partner game practice. I originally wrote code that had the same functionality as the fundamentals, got frustrated and went back to the fundamentals code.

1) 	Timer: 
	Countdown to zero with an alert that says "Game Over."

2)	Score: 
	A scoreboard that adds '5 points' to a correct match.

3)	Clicks:
	A click tracker to see how many clicks it takes to complete a round.

4)	Reset:
	A reset button to restart game including timer, score and clicks.

5)	Sound:
	a.	Play sound at the beginning of the game
	b.	Play sound when matched cards
